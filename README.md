  Cryptography foundations inbuilt in the python language while developing their own encryption software using multiple hashing techniques. In this project I use python’s hashlib library to use its SHA256 and MD5 algorithms.

Goal:
● Study the Encryption and Decryption Algorithms and create a console based application to demonstrate the encryption and decryption process.

1) Cryptography is used to protect and secure the data during communication.
Cryptography is a science of protecting the information by transforming it into a secured format. This process has been used for centuries to send the secret messages, where the message to be sent can not be read by the unauthorised users and can only be ready by the intended receiver.
So cryptography can be done in two ways to protect the data

2) Hashing requires a hash() function, and these hash() functions are very useful and are used in various information security applications. A hash function is a mathematical function which converts the numerical or string
input/message to another compressed and complex numeric value and in unreadable form.

For example: If we want to create a hash of the string “hello” then this string will get converted to an encrypted value which will be in unreadable form. And also the hash() functions are irreversible, that is we can not get the original data back from the hash. Basically the hash functions are used in securing the passwords for any application.

For example: When you create a gmail password while signing up into the google account, some encoding function like a hash function is applied on the password and stored in the form encrypted value in the database. And when you try to login in to gmail and write the password, this password is cross checked with an encoded password stored in the database, and if it matches then it allows you to use your gmail account.
  
On a single click we can convert a huge text into a small hash value which holds the same.
Many lines of text are difficult to remember but using hashing function we can get one line of code which is easy to remember.
  
3) Encryption and Decryption :- Encryption basically is a process which transforms the original data into an unrecognisable or unreadable form. In this the encryption algorithms are used to convert the data into unreadable form. That's the reason why the hackers can't hack these data. Once encryption is done and sends the data, at the receiver’s end the data is again converted to the original form and hence it is called as the Decryption.

  <h2 align="center">Functions or Modules</h2>
  
1) hashlib :- python comes with the inbuilt hashing module which is the Hashlib module. Python’s hashlib module is an interface for hashing messages easily.
This contains various methods which will perform hashing on any string and encrypt it. The core purpose of this module is to use a hash function on a string,
and encrypt it so that it is very difficult to decrypt it.
